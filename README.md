__Track file__

In the game flow you get asked to choose a track file. This is 
file for the game board.
The name of the available default tracks:

    1. challenge.txt
    2. oval-anticlock-right.txt

Feel free to upload your own track file in the correct directory.
Make sure the track fits the rules: 

    1. The track must be rectangular 
    2. The car ID (A, B, C, ...) must be identifying -> unique in the whole track 
    3. The finish line is oriented in one defined direction (see default tracks)
